## Rebuilding Dashboards

The ConfigMaps in this folder can be regenerated using the script `./hack/generate-configmaps.sh` located at the root of the repository.

We use [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) and supporting libraries in the [dashboards folder](../dashboards) to help generate the dashboards.
